# Shawnee State Bully

This is a game that I helped make with some friends my freshman year of college. I chose not to refactor it so that I can come back and look at this in the future. The idea behind this game was to make a 2d version of the popular game *Bully* from Rockstar games except at our own school. We never finished the game, but we did lay all the ground work in order to expand the game. For example, we have a the ability to add multiple maps very easily. We can also supply a sprite sheet and a list of x,y coordinates and have a npc walk between the coordinates on a track. 

This game is written in python 3

## Running the game

In order to run this game you will have to have a couple things installed in your environment. However besides that, running the game is fairly simple. All you need to do is pull down the project and run *main.py*.

### Prerequisites

The only real prereq to running this game is that you need to have the python 3+ installed and have the library pygame installed.

## Inside the Game

I don't expect anyone to actually download and run this game, so here are a couple screenshots from inside the game. 

This is the main menu

This is where you start, note the debug tools in the upper left corner. The main thing quests are based on is amount of books.
